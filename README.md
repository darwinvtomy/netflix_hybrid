A Flutter project Which Supports Android TV.

## Getting Started

This project is mvp for Android TV apps in flutter

I have used some resources for this project:

- [# fluent_ui Package I have used for focus and hovering](https://pub.dev/packages/fluent_ui)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
